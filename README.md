# TestUnity


Notes:

- You can try out game by launching Test.exe in Build folder.

- Gun is meant to be shot by holding down left mouse button, not tapping it.

- Enemies try to hide when gun is shot, else they try to run past you which will result in game over.

- Git is currently not set up in my computer, so i uploaded by hand.
